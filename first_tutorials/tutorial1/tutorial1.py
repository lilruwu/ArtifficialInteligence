# Numpy is a great framework, but it cannot utilize GPUs to accelerate its numerical computations. For modern deep neural networks, 
# GPUs often provide speedups of 50x or greater, so unfortunately numpy won’t be enough for modern deep learning.

# Here we introduce the most fundamental PyTorch concept: the Tensor. 
# A PyTorch Tensor is conceptually identical to a numpy array: a Tensor is an n-dimensional array, 
# and PyTorch provides many functions for operating on these Tensors. Behind the scenes, Tensors can keep track of a computational graph 
# and gradients, but they’re also useful as a generic tool for scientific computing.

# Also unlike numpy, PyTorch Tensors can utilize GPUs to accelerate their numeric computations. 
# To run a PyTorch Tensor on GPU, you simply need to specify the correct device.

# Here we use PyTorch Tensors to fit a third order polynomial to sine function. 
# Like the numpy example above we need to manually implement the forward and backward passes through the network:

import torch
import math
import datetime

dtype = torch.float
device = torch.device("cpu")
# device = torch.device("cuda:0") # Uncomment this to run on GPU

# Create random input and output data
x = torch.linspace(-math.pi, math.pi, 2000, device=device, dtype=dtype)
y = torch.sin(x)

# Randomly initialize weights
a = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)
b = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)
c = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)
d = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)

learning_rate = 1e-6
for t in range(2000):
    # Forward pass: compute predicted y
    y_pred = a + b * x + c * x ** 2 + d * x ** 3

    # Compute and print loss
    loss = (y_pred - y).pow(2).sum().item()
    if t % 100 == 99:
        print(t, loss)

    # Backprop to compute gradients of a, b, c, d with respect to loss
    grad_y_pred = 2.0 * (y_pred - y)
    grad_a = grad_y_pred.sum()
    grad_b = (grad_y_pred * x).sum()
    grad_c = (grad_y_pred * x ** 2).sum()
    grad_d = (grad_y_pred * x ** 3).sum()

    # Update weights using gradient descent
    a -= learning_rate * grad_a
    b -= learning_rate * grad_b
    c -= learning_rate * grad_c
    d -= learning_rate * grad_d


# Save the result into a file
output_file = f"output.txt"

with open(output_file, 'a') as f:
    f.write(f'Result ({datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}): y = {a.item()} + {b.item()} x + {c.item()} x^2 + {d.item()} x^3\n')
